      <h1>Hi, I'm Kelsey</h1>
      <h3>I'm a software developer based in Boise, Idaho.</h3>

      <h2>A little about me:</h2>
      <p>I first became interested in coding while living in Seattle and attending "Women in Tech" events downtown. Even after I moved back home to Idaho, my interest in coding stayed with me and I finally decided to take the plunge and learn how to code myself!</p>
      <p class="second-p">I love discovering how software works. I'm passionate about a career that involves constant learning and research, and I'm loving the perpetual deep-dive into new coding concepts that is the life of a developer.</p>
